            I had to learn that I could be a plain old playful dog as long as my halter was off.<br>
             But once  it was onâ€¦ I was working.

             I became the eyes of my master and their safety <br>and how they got around was up to me.

            After a long time in school, I graduated and my trainer introduced me to BJ.<br>
            The person who would become my master. We were both excited.

            We trained together for several weeks and became very good friends.
            <br>
            She was really nice and we always spent fun-time together once she took my halter off.
